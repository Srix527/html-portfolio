<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Samantha Rix, a wife of 6 years, a mom to two energetic boys, and a lover of all things creative. My days are filled with music—whether I’m playing or listening to it—and I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and things to learn. I love solving problems and finding creative ways to make life both fun and fulfilling for my family.</p>

<p>Being a mom to two boys is beautiful yet challenging. They’ve taught me to see the world from a different perspective and match their boundless energy, which has been an exciting adventure! One of my greatest joys is finding new activities that keep them entertained and light up their curiosity.</p>
  
<p>In my 6 years of marriage, I’ve discovered that having the right person by your side makes life’s journey smoother. My husband and I strive for a balance between rest and entertainment, supporting each other through it all. Every day is a choice to love, and that commitment has brought us closer together in ways I could have never imagined.</p>
  
<p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope to share a bit of the creativity, family life, and joy that fills my world!</p>
